# Ray Tracer

## Introduction
This simple ray tracer is implemented in C++,
following the tutorial from *Ray Tracing in One Weekend* as well as *Ray Tracing the Next Week*
from [raytracing.github.io](https://github.com/RayTracing/raytracing.github.io).
All books are free and open source. The aim of the project is to build a simple ray tracer from
 the ground up, while trying implementing some common-used techniques in the field of rendering.
It also serves as a playground for experimenting with other rendering algorithms.
